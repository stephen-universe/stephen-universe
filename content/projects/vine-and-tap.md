highlights: "<p><em>I worked on this project as part of a team and my role consisted
  of </em><strong><em>layout design</em></strong><em> and </em><strong><em>creating
  visual elements</em></strong><em> to be used within the UI Design.</em></p> "
brief: "<p>Vine & Tap is an exciting gastropub & wine bar located in the heart of
  the Buckhead district in <strong>Atlanta, Georgia.</strong> The winery offers small
  bites along with main course dishes paired well with their huge lists of wines to
  indulge.</p>"

  professional user experience and also provide well designed reusable templates for
  print.</p>"
company-goals: |-
  <p><em>Gain more online exposure</em> </p> <br/>

  <p><em>Increase reservations</em> </p>
pain-points: "1. Web Design does not mimic the culture of the establishment. <br/>\n2.
  Can not make reservation directly from site. <br/>\n3. Needs to provide a full user
  experience. "
